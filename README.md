# ZooManager
This is a C# WPF application that talks to a database.

The data base is a MS SQL server that is hosted as a docker image.

The intention of the project is to use various WPF elements with handled events. I have added a database with 2 tables "Zoo", "Animal" and a relation table to determine which animal belongs to which zoo.

There are some buttons to CRUD zoos and animals as well.
